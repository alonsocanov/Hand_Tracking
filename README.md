# Hand Tracking

Simple script for hand tracking using mediapipe library.

More trainig examples are needed and a validation dataset is needed.

In order to make the landmarks irrelevant to the positon in the image distances are clalculated bettween al llandmarks and a specific landmark, to make detection better two landmarks could be useded for distances. Then this distance is normaliced between two lanlandammrs that usually don chance.
